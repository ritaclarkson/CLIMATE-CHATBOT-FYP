Scientists have been able to rule out natural events as causes of climate change, such as volcanic activity, changes in solar activity, or natural sources of CO2.  These may, however, have a small effect, on top of human contributions. In their most recent report, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that human activity is 'extremely likely' to be the main cause of climate change.", "The evidence is clear: the main cause of climate change is burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal. When burnt, fossil fuels release carbon dioxide into the air, causing the planet to heat up.", "Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat and stop it escaping into space. We call these 'greenhouse gases'. These gases act as a warming blanket around the Earth, known as the 'greenhouse effect'.", "The greenhouse gases absorb some of this infrared radiation, instead of it passing straight out into space. The atmosphere then emits radiation in all directions, sending some of it back to the surface, causing the planet to heat up.

When we take these out of the land and burn them, we release the stored carbon dioxide into the air.", "Deforestation \u2013 Forests remove and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Cutting them down means that carbon dioxide builds up quicker since there are no trees to absorb it. Not only that, trees release the carbon they stored when we burn them.", "Agriculture \u2013 Planting crops and rearing animals releases many different types of greenhouse gases into the air. For example, animals produce methane, which is 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. The nitrous oxide used for fertilisers is ten times worse and is nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide!", "Cement \u2013 Producing cement is another contributor to climate change, causing 2% of our entire carbon dioxide emissions." ],

Rises in temperature match closely with an increase in the amount of greenhouse gases.", "The first line of evidence is our fundamental understanding of how certain gases trap heat, how the climate system responds to increases in these gases, and how other human and natural factors influence climate. The second line of evidence is from reconstructions of past climates using evidence such as tree rings, ice cores, and corals. The third line of evidence comes from using climate models to simulate the climate of the past century, separating the human and natural factors that influence climate. When the human factors are removed, these models show that natural variations are too small to explain the amount of warming.", "\u201cFingerprint\u201d studies that are able to attribute observed climate changes to particular causes.
